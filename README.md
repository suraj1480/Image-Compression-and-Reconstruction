# Image Compression and Reconstruction Using Huffman Encoding
## Description
This project demonstrates image compression and reconstruction using Huffman encoding and BPSK modulation in MATLAB. The process involves reading a grayscale image, compressing it using Huffman coding, transmitting it over a noisy channel using BPSK modulation, and then reconstructing the image at the receiver end. The bit error rate (BER) is also calculated to evaluate the performance.
